### RUBY LEARNING REPOSITORY

Ruby Learning is an online ruby tutorial which provides mentor to students.  
The mentor guides students on how to approach exercies and how to write better codes.
Special thanks to my mentor Victor Goff :+1:  

The folders of this repository contain all the exercises I worked through during the course. 
For those interested in learning at their own pace with the assistance of a mentor checkout Ruby Learning!
