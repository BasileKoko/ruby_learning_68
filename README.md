## RUBY LEARNING REPOSITORY
http://courses.rubylearning.org/catalog

On my journey to learning Ruby, I have used different materials.
Ruby Learning was one of those. It was very useful as they do have
great mentors to comment and provide assistance on the exercises and codes we write during the course. 
Special thanks to my mentor Victor Goff :+1:

The folders of this repository contain all the exercises I worked through. 
For those interested in learning at their own pace with the assistance of a mentor checkout Ruby Learning!
